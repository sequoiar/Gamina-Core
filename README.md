Gamina Core
===========

First use this from www.gamina.org, later you can modify it. But please do fork!!


To download or use this:
	npm install gamina

The core file here are only for people that want to fork, to improve the core library only and push back the change, not the examples of using gamina.

Again, a good starting place is, that has the examples:
	npm install gamina
 
Also do:
	npm update 
to get the latest changes.
