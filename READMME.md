Gamina Core
===========

To download or use this:
	npm install gamina

The core file here are only for people that want to pull, to improve the core library only, not the examples of using gamina.

Again, a good starting place is:
	npm install gamina
 
Also do:
	npm update 
to get the latest changes.

There is a google group gamina for discussion of users of it:
	https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/gamina
but that you should get from notes from the npm.
